# Scientific writing dicts

 A stash of scientific dictionaries for use when working in VS code or similar. 

Want to make:

- Aspden lab specific terms - names, common techniques and cell types.
- General bioinformatic terms - software names, variables, terminology.
- Species list - scientific names.
- General biological terms.


Some written by me, other words adding by scraping relevant papers, and filtering out words already in dict.
